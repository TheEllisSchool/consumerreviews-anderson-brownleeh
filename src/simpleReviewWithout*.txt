Cheap. Stop working after a week. 
These lights looked great when I first put them up. 
I have them hung on my wall and nothing happened to them to cause 
them to stop working. The remote is fine, you have to be pointing it 
directly at the small box in order for it to work. 
They are fairly bright, but again all stopped working at once.
